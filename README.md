# Guides for New Computers

In this repo you can find a collection of guides on how to self host and self publish with p2p tools. Feel free to submit PRs and open issues for ideas or errors you run in to or to suggest a new guide.

We are also discussing ongoing development of more simple plug &amp; play dat-pi server to improve accessibility of these tools. Please see the discussion in issues for the latest.

## Why self host

P2P publishing enables people to publish content and information to the web from their personal computers without the need of server or centralized platform. This fundamentally changes the relationship people have to the internet by breaking the client server hierarchy and opens the realm of self publishing to everyone. This guides are aimed at helping people participate in this new, independent version of the internet.
